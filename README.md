# weather-dashboard

## Description

The motivation of this project is to build a weather dashboard web application that displays the current weather and 5 day forecast for a city. The focus of this project is to use server-side APIs (in this case OpenWeatherMap API) to retrieve data and use it in the context of our application. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This activity also reinforces concepts such as third party APIs, local storage, and JSON formatting. Also an important concept covered in this activity is using the documentation from the OpenWeatherMap API to understand how to retrieve data and implement it into our code.
